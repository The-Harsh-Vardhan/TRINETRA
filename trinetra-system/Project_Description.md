## ⭐ Research Papers
Here are some research papers closely aligned with your project on customer tracking and behavioral analytics in retail using computer vision:

1. Advanced Customer Behavior Tracking and Heatmap Analysis with YOLOv5 and DeepSORT (Mohamed et al., 2024)
   - Uses YOLOv5 and DeepSORT to analyze customer movement, generate heatmaps, and optimize product placement in real-time.

2. System and Method for Retail Customer Tracking in Surveillance Camera Network (Burke, 2016, Patent)
   - Describes a multi-camera retail tracking system matching faces at POS to earlier footage for behavior and interaction analysis.

3. Towards In-Store Multi-Person Tracking Using Head Detection and Track Heatmaps (Musaev et al., 2020)
   - Uses head detection and heatmaps for accurate multi-person tracking in store environments, addressing occlusions and trajectory mapping.

4. Video-CRM: Understanding Customer Behaviors in Stores (Haritaoglu et al., 2013)
   - One of the earliest systems for group detection at checkout and product interaction tracking using stereo cameras.

5. Deep Learning-Based Approach to Detect Customer Age, Gender, and Expression in Surveillance Video (Ijjina et al., 2020)
   - Proposes WideResNet and Xception for demographic and emotion detection in low-quality retail CCTV footage.

## ⭐ WORKFLOW
Here's a comprehensive end-to-end workflow for your TRINETRA system — from the moment a customer arrives at the shop until they exit — detailing every camera’s role, every analytic recorded, and how the system interacts in real time.

### 🧠 TRINETRA Smart Surveillance Workflow

#### 🏪 Scenario:
A customer visits a retail store equipped with a multi-camera AI-powered computer vision system.

### 🟢 1. Customer Arrival (Outside the Shop)
#### 🎥 Camera 1: Outdoor Entry Camera
**Function:** Detects approaching individuals and vehicles.
- License Plate Recognition (LPR):
  - Detects and OCRs vehicle number using OpenALPR or PaddleOCR.
  - Matches to existing customer database.
  - Links vehicle ID to customer profile.

### 🚶 2. Entry Detection
#### 🎥 Camera 2: Overhead Entrance Camera (Inside)
**Function:** Detects when people enter or exit.
- People Detection (YOLOv8) + Tracking (ByteTrack or Deep SORT)
  - Draws virtual line across entrance to classify entry vs exit.
  - Increments footfall count.
  - Triggers the Face Capture Event on entry.

### 🧑 3. Customer Identification
#### 🎥 Camera 3: Face Recognition Camera at Entry
**Function:** Captures face and runs recognition.
- Face Detection + Embedding Comparison (DeepFace or face_recognition)
  - If recognized:
    - Fetches Customer ID from database.
    - Adds timestamped visit log.
  - If unrecognized:
    - Classifies as new customer.
    - Stores face encoding and snapshot.
    - Flags for registration at billing counter.

### 🕵 4. In-Shop Tracking
#### 🎥 Camera 4: Top-View or Corridor Cameras
**Function:** Re-identifies and follows customer through store.
- Person Re-ID based on face, clothing (color histograms), or deep embeddings.
- Logs:
  - Dwell time at different zones
  - Movement path (heatmap)
  - Waiting time (e.g. in queue)

### 🤖 5. Object & Appearance Analysis
#### 🧠 Triggered on Any Camera Where Full Body Visible
**Function:** Describes what the customer is wearing or carrying.
- Object Detection + Image Captioning (YOLOv8 + CLIP/BLIP)
- Output:
  - “Red t-shirt, black jeans, carrying backpack”
  - Saved as text description in customer profile.

### 🧾 6. Billing & Final Face Confirmation
#### 🎥 Camera 5: Billing Counter Camera
**Function:** Captures face + context at checkout.
- Face Verification:
  - Cross-matches with entry face → confirms identity.
- Fetch Bill Details (manual input or POS system OCR)
  - Total order value
  - Items bought
  - Staff name serving them
- Logs:
  - Visit duration = Exit time - Entry time
  - Average order value
  - Most frequent purchases (over time)

### 🟣 7. Exit Detection
#### 🎥 Camera 2 (Reused): Exit Line Crossing
**Function:** Detects when person leaves.
- Tracking ID used to mark exit time.
- Updates visit record with:
  - Total time spent
  - Zone-specific time
  - Queue duration
  - Served by staff X

### 📊 8. Real-Time Data Logging & Dashboard Update
- Database Updated:
  - Customer_Profile
  - Visit_History
  - Vehicle_Tracking
  - Staff_Interaction
- Dashboard Triggers:
  - Regular customer alert
  - High-value customer → Assign experienced staff
  - VIP alerts for staff awareness

### 🛡 9. Privacy & Security Checks
- Unknown faces are blurred or anonymized.
- All embeddings are encrypted.
- Data is retained under consent-driven retention policies.
